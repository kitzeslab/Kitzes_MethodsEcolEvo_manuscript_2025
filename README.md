# R Code for occupancy simulations using R Shiny app featured in Methods in Ecology and Evolution review (Kitzes et al. 2025) 

## This app supports the exploration of how different stages of the the sensors + AI
## pipeline affect bias and precision in single-season static occupancy models. Select parameters using the sliders,
## then click the button to simulate 10 data sets and fitted models. The parameter ranges below correspond roughly
## to those for a typical temperate bird survey in which recorders are deployed at many points
## for multiple days, although the same simulations apply to other vocalizing taxa
